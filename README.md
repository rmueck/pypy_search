# PyPI Search Tools üì¶

Two variants of pip (Pypy) search tools. Both variants where developed with help
of AI tools (Claude and Gemini). I started with Claude which produced a nice and
reliable solution after a few steps. I switched to Gemini to produce a solution
similar to the original `pip_search` with table output. This was a little hairy
but the final code was also reliable. The Gemini code is based on the Claude
generated code.
